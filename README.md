# publicSpendingAPI

The spendingAPI folder is the entire backend, whereas the example folder just has a small portion to show the controller -> service -> repository pattern.

For some context, the project is just a small backend for a small web app to keep track of my spending. In the app you just enter transactions you've made, with date, price, category, etc.
